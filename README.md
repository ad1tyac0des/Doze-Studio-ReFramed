# Doze Studios - ReFramed

Explore the reimagined website of Doze Studios, where I've integrated frame sequence animation to enhance the visual experience. Using GSAP, content flows dynamically, creating a seamless transition between visuals and text, giving the website a refreshed and engaging look.

## Features

- **Frame Sequence Animation:** Implemented using canvas to display a series of images as a smooth animation, controlled by scroll.
- **GSAP Integration:** Added GSAP for smooth content transitions, bringing life to the website as users scroll through the sections.
- **Preloader:** Custom preloader to ensure all assets are loaded before displaying the content, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure the animation and content display correctly across devices.
